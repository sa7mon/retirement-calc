# Dev Notes

* Initially, I got a little ambitious and started adding form fields to handle all the inputs, but got confused and overwhelmed quickly. 
* I took a step back and broke down the requirements into small pieces. The first of these I determined to be just getting a simple compound interest function working in code without taking any inputs from the page
* After thinking about it for a while, I figured the easiest way to arrange the method was to make a for loop that iterates from the age at which the retirement account starts, to the defined death age.
* Probably took 20-30 minutes to get it working correctly. I verified the answers with an online compound interest calculator
